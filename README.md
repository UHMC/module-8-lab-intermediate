# Module 8 - Intermediate Lab: Fancier Faucet

## Background
This lab will modify a pre-existing faucet smart contract to include additional features.

## Meta Information
| Attribute | Explanation |
| - | - |
| Summary | This assignment involves creating, deploying, and interacting with a faucet smart contract. |
| Topics  | Smart contracts, faucets, tokens. |
| Audience | Appropriate for CS1 or a later course. |
| Difficulty | Intermediate. |
| Strengths | This assignment exposes students to popular technology (blockchain) and some of its features. There is additional focus on some features of the Solidity programming language. |
| Weaknesses | It may be difficult for students to extend smart contracts without programming knowledge and familiarity with the Solidity programming language. |
| Dependencies | Some programming knowledge, an internet-connected computer with a suitable browser (for use of [the Remix IDE][Remix]), and a [MetaMask][MetaMask] account with [Rinkeby test ETH][RinkebyFaucet]. |
| Variants | Could be used to delve deeper into smart contracts, tokens, or use of general-purpose blockchains. |

## Assignment Instructions
1. Navigate to [https://remix.ethereum.org][Remix].
2. Click on the "+" at the top left corner of the screen.
    * This will create a new empty document to begin development.
3. Name the document `fancy-faucet.sol`.
4. Copy and paste into this file from the original faucet.sol; we will use it as a starting point for our modifications.
